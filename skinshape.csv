"Life as one,my god amazing song"
"Skinshape, an IPA, pistachios, I’m in heaven...."
Aaah Skinshape brings plp together 🌍💙👈
I love this.
"I walked into chipotle and heard this music faintly. I used SoundHound and stood on a chair to put it next to the speaker, thankfully it picked up a song by Beck I believe it’s called ( No Distraction) it was a remix. Then it put me on a playlist. I’m glad it did."
😍😍😍🌸🌺🌻🌸🌺🌺🌸🌻🌻🌺🌺🌸💃👋👋👋🇧🇻🇧🇻🇧🇻🇧🇻
"Back here again and each time such a treat, 'love it +++ and I'm gonna do my best to get the album as soon as we're not locked down anymore (since I do not purchase anything from Mr Bezos ""amaz'crap"", no way René-José !)"
amazing amazing gold music
Be careful with skinshape and ole uncle Sidney can be dangerous.
This album turn loneliness into creativeness
Músicas para ouvir chapado.
This is just delicious <3
So good EACH SONG ENDS WHEN IT SHOULD TOO
Hermoso
"This place feels like home already. 
If you read this - I hope you do well ✌"

When my children are conceived this will be playing in the background.

Los mejores minutos de mi vida
nice aIbum 4 have sex
. Happiness is the art of relaxation : )
"wonderful autumn afternoon, and I enjoy the music.....:)"
"An oasis to this weary traveler. The noisy commercial world is drowning, and this is the life vest they don't even care to find. Oh, well..."
"Not bad, a bit boring after a bit tho"
i am found...here i am floating in memory
Que bonito 🥺❤️
the transition at 14:30 surprised me
Este disco me vuela la cabeza de principio a fin.
You make life feel so easy and full of love. Your music keeps me clear when the walls are closing in again. Big love go's out to you my friend. From the bottom of my heart.... Thank you for what you created ♥️
Shimmer is a Work of art
hello
"Thank you, algorithm"
Life as one is way too short
Wish I could like this video twice
cool track
"dunno how this came on since i was listening to the cure before this while writing a paper, but im really glad it did!  im in a much better humour now!"
"first time hearing this just now, it found me. reminds me of the first time i heard badlydrawnboy's album hour of the bewilderbeast ... still listen sometimes, 15 years later... i think this one might stick a while too..."
"Smooth, Melodious, Relaxing and well performed."
"This guy is beyond phenomenal in producing music. The blending of instruments, the melodies he sings over it, etc.   Saying that he is talented is an understatement"
"Whether alone or in company, joy and peace can be found in Christ.  On a side note,  I love the musical arrangement of this song."
"C'est beau, comme la rencontre improbable puis messianique d'un parapluie et d'une machine à coudre sur une table de dissection."
"First i tought it was from hippie time, after i was thinking it was from today... then i realized is timeless"
thats sweet as bonobo (old) albums!!!!
Maravillosa música... Me llena emocionalmente
"when the trumpet  of self introspection  call's you, that make this album"
She just linked it to me. Now I am listening to this song in my headphones and watching her smile and how she is working at her laptop..
"It was a cold and dark September night, when I first discovered Skinshape, alas that was many years ago. I'm 98 years old now and still love to jam it out to Skinshape. Never stop rocking."
Thank You.
This is probably what God's fart sounds like
This sound remind me the music of Pink floyd
Um dos meus álbuns favoritos dessa vida
This guy is great. I'm so glad I discovered his music.
20;00
youtube recommendations has great taste in music
Never is there “not a good time” to jam this
"Hoy 10 de septiembre de 2020 acabó de descubrir a Skinshape. Ahí tienes año de mierda, por fin una buena para mi.

Pd: Estoy pegado con Metanoia y Shimmer."
YouTube algorithm auto play can be really very very good. How I wish I had this in the 90s. There was so much good music and we only got to hear some of it if we were lucky.
wow what a voice! stunning
People don’t have
So nice!
L💜ve it...
"u dont need to know skinshape(ss) to feel soooooo familiar with, man those sounds is like i know tham so well wthin me"
holy smokes shimmer
Majestic album.
"We come in numbers, we come with need
We have a reason to fight my greed
Just take a look, don't look too hard
You'll see your image, yourself surpassed
Don't be afraid, with open arms
This is the day to lay down arms
And with our strength, we'll be as one
A life of goodness, a life as one
A life as one, a life
A life as one

..."
Woa!!!
Love
what an epic music!
Awesome music!! I love it! Greetings from Peru :D
guys what music genre is this? i think i found my new favourite music genre
You must be very old...🤩
"You ever notice how, no matter how obscure the band, there's always someone who found them before you?"
Skinshape paired with premium cigars is ultimately the finest blend. Enjoying the finest things in life is so blissful
Why Not!!!
Not sure how I got here...glad it happened :)
Where has this little treasure been hiding?!
"« I didn’t know » the absolute one. Listening to this when I was on vacation, enjoying the sun and the beach."
Timeless
"I check out random people’s youtube channels - the ones who commented on videos like this, and go to their playlists and end up finding songs and albums like this. Either that or just searching up random jibberish words into the YouTube search bar. Seems to be working for me, found some great music and musicians. Love it"
"I'm so happy I've found this channel. Honestly, I've been listening to it non stop."
Nice
impecable...
Shit! que vaina tan deliciosa para los oidos...
Esta vaina es hermosa.
"I love replaying this album while working, always gets me in a very good mood, thankyou Skinshape!"
Thanks for playing this for me Youtube.....damn.
That moment you realize the music you are listening to is YouTube algorithm choosing a great album to play after the previous song ended. Without knowing it I've been subconsciously grooving on this for 15 minutes. What a strange but great way to discover good music!
After Midnight make me crazy
"Do you guys know what is the best part of listen to this master piece?... THE COMMENTS, idk why but i feel so conected and happy with all the people in here         TODO BIEN AL 100 🌈🍃🍄✨"

I have such great taste in music. :3
"When Youitube Is in alignment with you,r mood and taste, you have this suggestion !  lol"
UFF amazing! ♥
"Esto me recuerda a tantas pastillas, ácidos, marihuana, éxtasis, el silencio, los setenta, hongos, y sobretodo a los cigarros rojos donde lo único de lo que me pude dar cuenta era de mi inmensa soledad, destrucción y añoranza. No es tan mal después de todo."
This is sweet!! Thanks for this 💎
wow this fucking rules
"que cd bom da porr@@@@@
good as fork <3"
"Honestly I love your work man, I discovered your music thanks to the song ""Don´t call my name"" since then I never cease to amaze me with your music and I liked this album a lot."
When you've now listened to this album 257 times......and counting!
If the existence of Earth was mapped out on a 24 hr time clock man would be present only for the last 2 seconds. That's mind blowing just like this music.
"The first time I played Skin shapes, my neighbours threw a Brick through my window, so they could hear it better."
SO SMOOTH...
"you give me peace, you give me chances to live <3 thanks"
Amazing 💜💜💜
This album is a pure masterpiece. Much Love to everyone who enjoy it !
I listened to this for hours in one listen. Thanks for the ride!
"wow tho. Just, wow"
WOW !!! WHAT FANTASTIC UPLIFTING POSITIVE ENERGY MUSIC...REALLY GOOD STUFF...THANK YOU😊😊❤🌏🌍🌎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💥
what grand sound and epic channeling
Ingenious album ! Magic !
"this...this is a stunning work of art. this puts me in the most relaxed and blissful state, even if im not feeling great before listening. i am CONSTANTLY looking for music like this and cant seem to find it very often, but this is exactly what im looking for. im so grateful for musicians who pour their entire heart, soul, and consciousness into their work, and this masterpiece is a perfect example of this sort of genuine expresssion."
Ngl these are some beats to relax/study to
"Great music, great album. I'm really digging Skinshape lately. Clearly a mixing error at 19:57"
this is my favourite album
20:30 !!!
"Went to see Palace in March 2017, they were playing a gig at Whelans in Dublin! He was playing bass with the lads & they sounded fucking incredible. He left the band shortly after and I was sad! I realised now he had to go his own route because this is musically so different than the sound Palace were illustrating! Delighted he chose to venture down this unique route."
"Smoking a fine cigar watching the sunset over the mountains to this, pure bliss...."
i quite like the album. thank you for your participation in it.
Is anybody listening now ?
Just had services for the 30 year love of my life ...😢💯❤️ and this album has helped me Center myself and reflect on times had and that were supposed to be ... thank you 🙏🏽 😔😇❤️
this is unbelievably good...thanks you tube algorithm.
"Que placer escuchar música actual de este calibre, de mis favoritos!"
Wooooow ! this is good :)
That little solo at the very first seconds was enough to get me hooked.
Why have I only just discovered Skinshape? This is gorgeous....
"Skinshape opens the door of dejavu and imagined lifetimes, kaleidoscope of images, nostalgia for unlived memories"
Nice lullaby...
I didn't know was veryyy fucking beautiful
"jeeez this give me guitar solo idea, dont respect the scale bru :D id blues the fk out of this"
"Oye, a proper ""Ska"" band, focused on current struggles and topics concerning humanity. True that, and this crew truly gets  the vibe."
If everyone tried it there would be world peace. 👁
I think I have a new addiction.....a healthy one for a chance >> SKINSHAPE!!!!
nice to meet you
"""i didn´t know "" its the best song ever <3 with that song i get to know Skinshape and NO REGRETS (From Chile)"
love reading the comments in this kind of music y'all have really good vibes
This is amazing
This Is So Chill!
"Filoxiny, love to the strangers"
Too many ads on this channel
<3

Awesome work! Skinshape found me and I feel blessed
444 morons fck m all go listen to Korn
"arjantindeyim, sokaklarda amacsizca yuruyorum. kulagimda bu album caliyor. dunyanin her hangi bir yerinde ozgurce geziyorum"
"Been listening for a few hours alone with a candle and beer. It was funny because I was thinking about how nice it would be to be wrapped around someone and just this, and a song just so happens to say the same thing i was feeling. Fukcing nice! The exact thing. Right time. Xoxo"
"Headphones on, eyes closed, mind expanded, journey started."
Glad I decided to listen!
"so glad people are finally finding and appreciating this beautiful piece of art. a 32 minute journey of ups and downs and intense emotion, music straight from the soul <3"
there are moments in life that all I want is for my sounds to be heard from random people around the world and help them express random feelings that I really never thought about.
this reminds me of myself and I don't have a self
"Thanks for posting. Skinshape proves there still are phenomenal new groups out there. The music is beautifully performed and written.  I love this song and many others.  I am an 80s music fan(Goth, New Wave), but  I am still always searching for new music. Perfect music for anything and everything."
House of the rising sons
"I left my computer and came back. It was a question: ""Are you still watching?"" and I just thought lets give it a try and then I fell in love with this music so then I read the name, Skinshape. That was so catchy."
This album is out of this world
"I love listen this type of music right now, rain, coffee and just myself. Great job"
<3 <3 <3 eargasm
chapadah
reminds me of club penguin café music
"12:20
esto es lo que se siente la nostalgia? ;'("
"What a great album, thank you"
Fucking awesome!
anyone else shutting everything out at 3am and absorbing in this album like sponge?
I just can't stop...
The beat at 20:20 has nice Homestuck soundtrack vibes
"That is flocking nice, glad I came across you! You rock!"
Great job !! THX !!!

elevator music
"I'm trying to sleep but they have a memories in my mind, that's hurt."
6:58 gets me every time
Thank you YouTube algorithm
"Often ""We Lose"" ourselves tirelessly working midnight ""After Midnight"" , this album called ""Filoxiny"" I reckon, asks us to ""Breathe"" a little for us and ""Shimmer"" down on the exhausting life. ""I Didn't Know"" this kind of music could talk you into considering this ""Life As One"" small town ride where you pace yourself. ""Metanoia"" is my favourite song here. What's yours?"
wow what a find
muito bom!
"Primera vez que escucho está banda ,llegué por accidente ,empezaré a escucharlos ya,un comentario en español , saludos a tod@s."
this is straight dope
"That first track reminds me of Careful With That Axe, Eugene by The Pink Floyd."
So good
"clean and clear, this is dear..my, my, my....very nice. gonna listen again... and again... and............."
This was just what I needed right now.
This album is like a precious treasure box!
Wow this LP is at around $100 at discogs
"i cant stand this anymore, please stop sending me here youtube."
Everything on this sounds divine ✨
"If you're reading this, take it easy. Relax, just enjoy these tunes n continue to put that positive energy out there 🙌🏼"
I love u all
Only music that distracts me from distractions. Love it
"VIDEO PAUSED - Continue watching?
YES I'm going to continue watching. TF is wrong with you?"
"Hmm sounds like an album I am going to buy,  this is available on CD?"
8:15
awesome♡♡♡
14:47
Holy shit im relaxed
"holy shit.... this is so good and so psychodelic i love it, im so glad i skinshape found me,"
"Second song sounds awesome!
Thanks Skinshape"
"This album started playing while having the autoplay and working late with days of little sleep accumulated and stress built up. But when this album started playing it was like telling me to relax and calm down during those tiresome lonely late night/dawn hours. I felt relief and taken care of. I love this, especially ""Life as One."""
"Brutal! Un álbum lleno de percepciones, sentimientos y anhelos, muchas gracias. 🇨🇴🎧🖤"
지리고 오져버린다
Those first 10 seconds got me hooked. So glad this came up in my recommended.
"Sitting by a small fire, sipping red wine and smoking a cigar. My sight meandering between the flames and the night sky and reflecting on all that weighs on my mind.. Skinshape is just right for this feeling."
Legal d +
Metanoia is a Greek word.
28:36
"Ah perfect, it's just after midnight that the first song started. What are the odds"
12:22
4:40
How is this albums mix so crisp and warm at the same time... Wow.
15:20 ufffffff
"Skinshape came to me in the worst part of my life which suddenly changed dramatically, even with covid 19 ...great albums, all of them!"
que buena miusik <3
"""l Didn't Know""....proper sweet vibe"
this is new pink floyd
Everybody be sampling romance I love it
all algorithmic roads end with skinshape. so bland.
"Makes me think of Skin Scapes,  the seedy spy bar in the hallucinatory  _The Singing Detective_"
"This is totally some smoke some weed, draw and chill vibes"
"i find this masterpiece into the corona virus pandemic time,i feel safe 💜"
I no have words to describe 'Metanoia' and all of the rest of this album. SKINHAPE! I just love you!
Just can't get enough of this
Su voz es igual a la de Jacob Hemphill (S.O.J.A)!!!!
How we got here doesn't matter. What matters is we stayed.
We’re all friends ❤️
this is gorgeous have a great day beautiful people
nice stuff!
One of the best bands of this decade
the drumming is so sick in these songs
"I've got goosebumps when I listen to this, only really good music makes me feel that way. There isn't a single track that makes me ""meh"" and want to skip it! Skinshape is incredibly talented! I totally understand why he focuses on creating music instead of touring and rehearsing with a band... but damn, I'd love to hear a live performance in Paris. :)"
wow! amazing!
This is a sound I want to experiment with in live sets. COVID 2019.
Why in the heck nobody told me these people exist?! This is real music. Thanks for making me believe real music is not dead.
"This whole album reminds me of my first sexual experience, not because it was playing or anything no, they both ended to soon 🤭"
"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm lecker Schniddschä willst dich an mei Tischschä sidzä.... aaa jaaa komm lecker, lecker, lecker Drinkschä."
soundtrack for my quarantine. (:
those trumpets yes
"Isto é música, música é liberdade.."
Dark Feeling
"kinda reminds me of skalpel, my best find of this week"
"what i just found, my favorite band out of youtub reccomendation, what a groovy retro upbeat , loved it !"
I never find anything like skinshape
"You know, I just recently discovered this channel's bedroom pop live stream which I really enjoyed so I subscribed to have it appear in my subscription feed. However, I wondered whether I'd regret my decision and how good the uploads would be. As I scrolled down I noticed that this channel had uploaded an entire Skinshape Album. It was at that moment I realized I do not have to worry."
Nice!!!.... I never have listened this band.... That's what i call trip-hop
"i never thought that after almost 3 years listening to skinshape i would be here reading all of this coments and seeing all of this views. im glad that you guys discover this, and also im craying cuz all of this sounds remember such a hard time, and at the same time heals that pain. Thanks Skinshape, thank you humans for support this amazing band."
"Steps to get into it deeper:
- Isolate
- Lie down
- Put on your headphones 
- Let your imagination fly
- Start the journey
(And don’t forget to press the reset button)"
makes crying sessions more enjoyable

Thank you

"Tits on a bull....bull in a china shop..bull in the heather... goes to the head of the class...passes past past class...fox in the bushes...meant to last...cast to clasp..aghast ..a gasp...first class....

...hall of fame...first time ballot..a blast.....time for recess"
"I got this recommended off my own EP, guess it's pretty normal?"
Los asquerosos anuncios destruyen la magia de este maravilloso álbum.
"Não sei como achei, mas foi bom ter achado"
"trabajaba en un café y para ambientar el lugar me ponía música ya que yo era el único barista , el café era bastante bueno y el lugar pequeño pero muy acogedor, skinshape llego así como a algunos de ustedes sin haberlo buscado y desde entonces recuerdo la sensación de lo hermoso que era preparar un café, escuchar esta música y dejar que los demás disfrutaran de ese momento."
"i've already lost the count on how many times ""i didn't know"" has made me cry"
ANTI DEPRECION <3
amazing music :)
A cualquier cosa se le llama disco hoy en dia...
Sounds like dope lemon no?
I have this on rewind in my coffeehouse...aka my kitchen
thank you for making me feel so good <3
realmente me encanta
Man for a time I used to listen to this song for my 5am morning routine. Just the beginning reminds me of that unpleasant feeling of not having had enough sleep
"this is album is a real experience, a real trip"
"thank you, saved this into my playlist :3"
"Skinshape anounced that all albums are (during this the easter week-end) FREE or ""name your price"" on bandcamp."
too chill
Is this made of computers or real? Must be humans :D
Probably one of my favorite albums ive discovered this year eat a dose and just ride the gentle waves of bliss into infinity
Music to rummage through your dead grandfather's old stuff to
"Actually ""filoxiny"" should literally translate to ""fond of sourness/acidity"", wheter filoxenia means hospitable. Both quite makes sense in a weird way!"
"Oasis album ""Don't Believe the Truth"" sounds different in this video."
"i love this album, everytime i come back<3"
Este álbum me hace olvidar mis problemas ('':💕

I’ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety and losing focus lately and let’s just say I’m glad I found this.

This album has no business being this chill.
"We Lose (Lyrics):

[Verse 1]
Oh, my heart that was broke in two
By a cruel, cruel world of sin
Where we reach our grave and we find our peace
It is only then we know

[Chorus]
I've worked hard
And I've been kind
Don't I deserve my life?
But what he doesn't know
Is that he can't pretend
He can't hold back the lies

[Verse 2]
Be my wall and I won't forget
Your face, your loyalty
While you dream of gold
Many lies are sold to satisfy your greed

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and wait
Your fate is not yours to choose
You can try to realise
But in the end we lose
We lose, we lose"
"Life as One (Lyrics):

[Verse 1]
The ocean where we lie
See the stars tonight
The ocean where we lie
See the stars tonight
The glow of concrete skies
See the distant lights
The glow of concrete skies
See the distant lights

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
We come in numbers, we come with need
We have a reason to fight my greed
Just take a look, don't look too hard
You’ll see your image, yourself surpassed
Don't be afraid, with open arms
This is the day to lay down arms
And with our strength, we'll be as one
A life of goodness, a life as one
A life as one, a life
A life as one"
"I Didn't Know (Lyrics):

I didn't know about those other things
I could've been there but now it's too late
But only here for one hour, you want it till it's gone
Try to find the best, I know you

I didn't know that you would leave so soon
I tried a little harder to make you smile once more
One day I'll come to find you, wherever you may be
Only time was kinder, you would still be here"
<3
Perfect music while we are confined :)
oh yes.
Its super shitty that y'all dont even own the music yet you put ads after every song. Is this money going to the creator?
"En tiempos de cuarentena, este álbum ha sido de mis pocos sosiegos. Gracias en el alma."
Best recommendation yet
my new cafe backround musick .its so awsome
Nice post! Check out my original tunes on youtube here! I'll think you'll dig 'em! <3

"Kiedy na albumie nie masz ulubionej piosenki bo wszystkie są ulubione :D do tego nie masz nawet ulubionego albumu, takie są dobre  -  takie rzeczy tylko Skinshape"
"excelente album por la cresta/ very awsome album, guys. From Chile!"
"Lo estoy amando, ojalá venga a Perú"
Have a good day.
This comment is special :)
This album makes me feel like I finally have a home.
"Such a lovely work,  nice listening"
"People who play this at wingstop McDonald's or other food places 

I love u and thank you  🌌☺🌌"
OMG! Magic!
"Beautiful, thank you so much"
Lovely album. Good vibes. Good music. 🖤❣
skinshape  / i hope he keeps making music / it has powerful healing resonance
"First Track  no diggity, while hitting a stone , if you dont get it ................."
Thank you  so  much! Hvala najlepše!
I honestly hope this Genre takes over the '20s . So bored with hiphop/rap.
All killer room filler
William was the bassist in Palace. Also very 'heady and crystalized.'
Just Wonderful <3
"I didn't expect much from this recommendation, but I'm staying"
"Shhhh... just, listen."
Easily in the Top 10 albums of the decade.
This music really goes down nicely with a big slice of brie and some champagne.
Sound Skipping all over me x
Ads are running it
Me smoking a joint this music is on point no holding  back just chilling  the creator is everywhere  existing🎷🎸🎹 thanks for  good music
best album for 2019 to chill at home doing everything~~~~!!!!!

At 15:10 life begins...
God damn elements 💫
Why isnt this from ninja tune?
this album is a Masterpiece!

"Heureusement qu'il y a les britanniques pour la musique, toujours à l'avant garde! Chez nous, en France, il y a de bons artistes, mais les malheureux restent inconnus à vie, surtout s'ils sont créatifs. L'espace sonore est monopolisé depuis des lustres par les marchands de soupe qui ne prennent aucun risque et nous inondent de variété à pleurer de nullité et de conformisme !"
The beat that kicks in around 27:27 is my soul rhythm.
"What does ""floxiny"" mean?"
delicia absoluta
le seul mot qui me viens à l'esprit est : excellence ! cz truck me donne envie de plané One Love
<3
"""we lose"" gets to me. But I've learned to somehow see it as something positive that we all lose"
this album is magical
"It had been a rough year and one day, after talking with my sister she showed me this jewel and I fell in love with it instantly. Since we do not live in the same house we are closer than ever, I'd say. This is how Skinshape found me."
One of the best albums I've ever heard
chill
i love this!!!! does anyone else think it sounds like a nicholas brittel score?
"Come play around these parts (Italy) sometime. Your fan (amongst many other Italian fans) (just come, will you? ciao)"
Wow wow wow!!!
"inspiring work! 

'i didn't know' :::: the lyrics are a bit cute and light weight, which gives it this sweet innocence when paired with the crazy simple rhythm / melodies. When the second verse ends I get overwhelmed by the horns each and every time. That is a sublime energy that I feel has come from a unique source.. imagine someone with little to no life experience trying to produce that emotion with such perfection. Impossible. 

'shimmer' ::::: it took me a little while to connect the dots on this track as far as what it reminds me of.. and I love the frustration of not knowing but feeling the connection to a past body of work. anyways, i figured it out hence why I am commenting; Grizzly Bear - Ready, able. I can hear it float in sync so nicely, it just kind of melds underneath this melancholic tune."
Pa andar bien FUmao...
I didnt dont know loooveitt
I am floating in fluffy white clouds of happiness and gratitude to these wonderful sounds and people.
"Yo yo, are you aware that your timestamps in your description box all link to the same song? Because you linked the song length, so they just skip to 3 minutes the album, or 4 minutes 30 seconds, 3 minutes 08 seconds into the album tc... Just thought I'd let you know."
"Nice to see how Will has evolved having known him in school, there was always something special in him, visible only through the eyes"
τιμιο.. ακους ντουκη;
Nothing kills the mood like an ad after every song
Wow. Just WOW!

"Your voice is speaking beyond the limits of physics out here in my garden on the little chair i am sitting on watching the stars, 3:00 AM, trying to assume how lonely i can be in term of love-relation, and enjoying the presence of one of my little friend between my 2 fingers :3"
curved air
Every one needs to chill to skinshape
"play shimmer at x1.5, the drums coming in sounds like the Doors see ya guys"
"The first night i listen this album, its been at the end of a party, me and the girl i like stay alone with a very good tea and then we go to thr couch and start to hug and cuddle, suddenly she stand and say me good night and enter on her room.i keep listening and enjoy the momement. Now im in bed with two beautiful girls and listen this again, i never knows what comes tomorrow but im happy
Thanx Skinshape
Saludos desde Valparaiso"
Skinshape just found me. Stoked 😎

"Good damn, just when I thought drugs were better than Real life.. Thank you!!"
Smooth album 😎
nothing sweeter than getting high as a pig after work and listening to the last two songs for 21031023120 times
"I always listen this album on hotel´s  roof (my work) My friend Chente and i always put this album to see the whole city. It´s incredible how all this sounds take the present scene, (the city lights) and make something magic with it when you look the stars."
So many feelings and emotions packed into one album. Easily one of the best albums of the decade.
10/10 for sure.
"this might be my favorite album for my 2019 , cant stop listening. much love from México"
The ads are killing me
"Dear Nice Guys:  Please fix your track listings, as all the start times are within less than 2 minutes of each other.  Thanks."

"On my way home from my stressful day as a nurse.. Sun is shining, a Little too warm in the car.. but that doesn't matter when this gem turns up unexpected!"
Is orgasmic
first track i've listened to was life as one. instant chills. it's been a while since a song gave me goosebumps
"I found this album in December. 

It was a good end of winter and a beautiful spring. 

Everey drawing day, i use Skinshape to inspire my mood. 

In some way i lost something this months. 

It was my girlfriend, but something more. 
The tranquility mornings with sun, fresh air and drawings.
Skinshape in the back.
The sentation of hope. 
A better future, something lime that. 

I don´t now what. But somethings lost.
And now, Skinshape hurts. 
In a beautiful way."
Pure.
"This is more than just music, just an album......this is something equivalent to the supernatural"

Skinshape ♥
Listened to this twice. Ordering LP now. Wow.
"is there any social media of this band?, really want to know how this band developed so well."
Perfect Album.
"Woah!
It's like being on mushrooms which unfortunately I am not,lol. I love it to the deepest corners of my mind and soul. I lost my USB card with all my music - I have no back up. So now I am spending my days on youtube, spotify and searching in my not so good memory. I love to discover new music, I swear it's something that makes me feel alive ... I really love you guys - people who feel this kind of music can not be bad people. We all have our ups and downs, but I truly believe music connects us and brings the best out of us! A lot of love from beautiful mountains in Romania <3"

This album turns loneliness into solitude. Love it.
Some damn good late night study music. Almost makes me happy to be here grafting into the late hours.
"This record is an embodiment of a beautiful life. The happy bits, the sad bits, the deep bits - this music sings the song of the soul."
"In my bed , tripping, here,  at São Paulo City and I can say ,this is a jewel album. Love it"

"When people say “Music these days suck, people don’t know how to make music anymore,  etc. etc.” I wish I could show them this side of YouTube.  Ohhh my friend you’re not looking in the right places . It’s out there right under your noses 🌞"
