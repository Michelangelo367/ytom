I realised now he had to go his own route because this is musically so different than the sound Palace were illustrating! Delighted he chose to venture down this unique route."

186,Thank you YouTube algorithm
187,"Often ""We Lose"" ourselves tirelessly working midnight ""After Midnight"" , this album called ""Filoxiny"" I reckon, asks us to ""Breathe"" a little for us and ""Shimmer"" down on the exhausting life. ""I Didn't Know"" this kind of music could talk you into considering this ""Life As One"" small town ride where you pace yourself. ""Metanoia"" is my favourite song here. What's yours?"

I love this, especially ""Life as One."""

242,"I've got goosebumps when I listen to this, only really good music makes me feel that way. There isn't a single track that makes me ""meh"" and want to skip it! Skinshape is incredibly talented! I totally understand why he focuses on creating music instead of touring and rehearsing with a band... but damn, I'd love to hear a live performance in Paris. :)"
243,wow! amazing!
244,This is a sound I want to experiment with in live sets. COVID 2019.

253,"what i just found, my favorite band out of youtub reccomendation, what a groovy retro upbeat , loved it !"
254,I never find anything like skinshape
255,"You know, I just recently discovered this channel's bedroom pop live stream which I really enjoyed so I subscribed to have it appear in my subscription feed. However, I wondered whether I'd regret my decision and how good the uploads would be. As I scrolled down I noticed that this channel had uploaded an entire Skinshape Album. It was at that moment I realized I do not have to worry."
256,Nice!!!.... I never have listened this band.... That's what i call trip-hop
257,"i never thought that after almost 3 years listening to skinshape i would be here reading all of this coments and seeing all of this views. im glad that you guys discover this, and also im craying cuz all of this sounds remember such a hard time, and at the same time heals that pain. Thanks Skinshape, thank you humans for support this amazing band."

304,"We Lose (Lyrics):

[Verse 1]
Oh, my heart that was broke in two
By a cruel, cruel world of sin
Where we reach our grave and we find our peace
It is only then we know

[Chorus]
I've worked hard
And I've been kind
Don't I deserve my life?
But what he doesn't know
Is that he can't pretend
He can't hold back the lies

[Verse 2]
Be my wall and I won't forget
Your face, your loyalty
While you dream of gold
Many lies are sold to satisfy your greed

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and wait
Your fate is not yours to choose
You can try to realise
But in the end we lose
We lose, we lose"
305,"Life as One (Lyrics):

[Verse 1]
The ocean where we lie
See the stars tonight
The ocean where we lie
See the stars tonight
The glow of concrete skies
See the distant lights
The glow of concrete skies
See the distant lights

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
We come in numbers, we come with need
We have a reason to fight my greed
Just take a look, don't look too hard
You’ll see your image, yourself surpassed
Don't be afraid, with open arms
This is the day to lay down arms
And with our strength, we'll be as one
A life of goodness, a life as one
A life as one, a life
A life as one"
306,"I Didn't Know (Lyrics):

I didn't know about those other things
I could've been there but now it's too late
But only here for one hour, you want it till it's gone
Try to find the best, I know you

I didn't know that you would leave so soon
I tried a little harder to make you smile once more
One day I'll come to find you, wherever you may be
Only time was kinder, you would still be here"
307,<3

367,13:00
368,"Heureusement qu'il y a les britanniques pour la musique, toujours à l'avant garde! Chez nous, en France, il y a de bons artistes, mais les malheureux restent inconnus à vie, surtout s'ils sont créatifs. L'espace sonore est monopolisé depuis des lustres par les marchands de soupe qui ne prennent aucun risque et nous inondent de variété à pleurer de nullité et de conformisme !"

380,"Come play around these parts (Italy) sometime. Your fan (amongst many other Italian fans) (just come, will you? ciao)"
381,Wow wow wow!!!
382,"inspiring work! 

'i didn't know' :::: the lyrics are a bit cute and light weight, which gives it this sweet innocence when paired with the crazy simple rhythm / melodies. When the second verse ends I get overwhelmed by the horns each and every time. That is a sublime energy that I feel has come from a unique source.. imagine someone with little to no life experience trying to produce that emotion with such perfection. Impossible. 

'shimmer' ::::: it took me a little while to connect the dots on this track as far as what it reminds me of.. and I love the frustration of not knowing but feeling the connection to a past body of work. anyways, i figured it out hence why I am commenting; Grizzly Bear - Ready, able. I can hear it float in sync so nicely, it just kind of melds underneath this melancholic tune."
383,Pa andar bien FUmao...
384,I didnt dont know loooveitt
385,I am floating in fluffy white clouds of happiness and gratitude to these wonderful sounds and people.
386,"Yo yo, are you aware that your timestamps in your description box all link to the same song? Because you linked the song length, so they just skip to 3 minutes the album, or 4 minutes 30 seconds, 3 minutes 08 seconds into the album tc... Just thought I'd let you know."
387,"Nice to see how Will has evolved having known him in school, there was always something special in him, visible only through the eyes"
